          <Paragraph>
            I&apos;m an aspiring technical strategist specialising in Computer Engineering. 
            I&apos;m passionate about building solutions that impact, and thrive at the intersection of tech, people, and product. 
            This summer, I&apos;m interning as an Algorithm Engineer at DSO National Laboratories, optimising clustering algorithms used for de-interleaving signals.

          <Paragraph>
            Outside of tech, I&apos;m always chasing the next challenge. 
            From representing my school National Taekwondo Competitions, to surfing waves in Portugal, performing live as part of a band, and solo-backpacking across Europe, I love pushing myself to explore unfamiliar terrain â€” physically, creatively, and culturally. 
            Now, I&apos;m taking on a new frontier, training for my first Ironman 70.3 Oceanside in Spring 2026!
