VF testing is a relatively time-consuming and tedious process, taking up to 10 minutes per patient, depending on the testing algorithm used. This does not include additional time required for equipment set up, patient transfer and explanation of testing process. Hence, when a patient\u2019s VF test results are unreliable, resource constraints make it challenging to schedule a retest in close time proximity. This leads to an inefficient use of appointment slots for the clinic, and a missed opportunity to collect valuable data for the patient\u2019s care. This would delay diagnosis or detection of disease progression.",
