My work focused on increasing computational efficiency by leveraging GPU-based systems, particularly through parallelising clustering algorithms on a HIP-based GPU architecture. I researched and implemented clustering techniques such as DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and Mean-Shift, and benchmarked their performance using simulated datasets. This experience deepened my understanding of high-performance computing, parallel algorithms, and the practical challenges of deploying GPU-accelerated systems.",

Reliability is often difficult to achieve, due to the initial learning curve for the patients, as well as variability in patient understanding and executing the test protocols. Current practices rely heavily on explanation and attention of the attending ophthalmic technician, and patient comprehension and cooperation \u2013 both of which may be highly variable, leading to unreliable results that can compromise the accuracy of disease monitoring. This undermines efforts to optimise treatment strategies tailored to individual patient needs.",

VF testing is a relatively time-consuming and tedious process, taking up to 10 minutes per patient, depending on the testing algorithm used. This does not include additional time required for equipment set up, patient transfer and explanation of testing process. Hence, when a patient\u2019s VF test results are unreliable, resource constraints make it challenging to schedule a retest in close time proximity. This leads to an inefficient use of appointment slots for the clinic, and a missed opportunity to collect valuable data for the patient\u2019s care.
