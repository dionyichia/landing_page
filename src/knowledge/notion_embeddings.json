        "title": "The Power of Positive Thinking",
        "text": "In the complex and often challenging world we live in today, it's easy to find ourselves trapped in patterns of negative thinking and pessimism. However, the transformative power of positive thinking is something that cannot and should not be underestimated. This blog post will delve deeply into the fascinating concept of positive thinking, its myriad psychological benefits, and how it can be consciously cultivated as a habit for personal growth, success, and overall well-being.\nUnderstanding Positive Thinking\nPositive thinking revolves around the intriguing process of manifesting thoughts that create and transform energy into reality. It represents a mental and emotional attitude that focuses unwaveringly on the bright side of life and constantly expects positive results.\nPositive thinking is absolutely not about pretending that life's less pleasant situations simply don't exist. It's not about turning a blind eye to the negative. Rather, it's about approaching these less than ideal situations in a more positive and productive way, firmly believing that the best is going to happen, not the worst. It's about viewing the glass as half-full rather than half-empty. It's about seeing problems as challenges and viewing these challenges as opportunities to grow, learn and evolve.\nThe Extensive Psychological Benefits of Positive Thinking\nPositive thinking brings with it a veritable wealth of psychological benefits. It has the potential to significantly enhance your mood and broaden your sense of possibility. This, in turn, allows you to develop and build new skills and resources that can provide immense value in other areas of your life.\nThere's a growing body of research to support the benefits of positive thinking. Studies have shown that a positive mindset can lead to better stress management and coping strategies, lower levels of depression, and even an increased life span. It's not just mental health that can benefit from positive thinking. Physical health can improve too. Positive thinking can improve cardiovascular health and notably reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease.\nCultivating Positive Thinking\nCultivating positive thinking is not a passive process. It's a habit that requires consistent practice, patience, and commitment. Start by identifying areas of your life that you usually think negatively about and make a conscious effort to spin them into something positive.\nSurround yourself with positive people who inspire and uplift you. Practice positive self-talk, and make it a point to start each and every day on a positive note. Set the tone for the day with positivity and watch how it influences your interactions, your work, and your relationships.\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to have negative thoughts sometimes. We're all human, and it's not about eliminating all negative thoughts. It's about not letting them control you, not letting them dictate your emotions, and not letting them affect your outlook on life.\nConclusion\nThe power of positive thinking is immense and far-reaching. It has the potential to transform your mental, emotional, and physical health, open up new opportunities, and lead you down a path of success and fulfillment. Remember, the mind is an incredibly powerful tool, and the thoughts we harbor within it can shape our reality. So, foster positivity, nurture it, and watch how it profoundly changes your life for the better."

        "title": "My Top 10 Books and Why I Love Them",
        "text": "Books have always been a significant part of my life, playing various roles. They've been my companions in solitude, my teachers in the quest for knowledge, and my windows into the minds of others. Through books, I've lived a thousand lives, visited places I've never been, and expanded my understanding of the world. They have served as a refuge during difficult times and a source of joy during periods of happiness. This post will delve into my top 10 favorite books, each one having left an indelible impact on me.\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee\nTo Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic that never fails to move me. It's a beautifully written tale of innocence, courage, and the struggle against injustice. Harper Lee paints a vivid picture of the racial tension in the deep south during the 1930s. This book is not just about racial inequality; it's also a profound study of human nature, about understanding people by stepping into their shoes. This lesson has resonated deeply with me and influenced my perspective on empathy and understanding.\n\"1984\" by George Orwell\n1984 is a chilling prophecy about the future that has left an indelible print on my mind. George Orwell's depiction of a dystopian society where surveillance and propaganda are rampant is a stark warning about the loss of individuality and freedom. This dystopian novel is not just a work of fiction; it's a mirror held up to humanity, reflecting our darkest fears about power, control, and loss of freedom. This book has made me value my rights as an individual and appreciate the democracy we often take for granted.\n\"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen\nPride and Prejudice is a timeless romance novel that I absolutely adore. Jane Austen's wit, character development, and exploration of societal norms in the 19th-century England are nothing short of brilliant. The story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy is not just a love story; it's a narrative about overcoming personal flaws, societal pressure, and the importance of understanding and overcoming one's prejudices. It's a tale that has taught me about the importance of self-awareness and personal growth.\nConclusion\nThe books I've mentioned are just three of my top 10 favorites that have shaped my life in one way or another. Each one of them has had a different impact, teaching me valuable lessons about life, society, and human nature. They've not only entertained me but also broadened my perspectives, ignited my imagination, and taught me to appreciate the complexity of the world we live in. I hope you find them as enlightening and enjoyable as I do and perhaps they might inspire you to explore new genres, authors, or themes in literature."

        "title": "The Evolution of EyeTracker",
        "text": "The Context\nGlaucoma is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Key to the management of glaucoma is the accurate and precise assessment of visual field (VF) function to detect VF loss from glaucoma and to monitor disease progression, which impacts important clinical decisions with respect to medication titration, laser procedures and even surgery. VF function is monitored commonly with automated perimetry; This utilises light stimulus and requires similar user interactions to evaluate the user\u2019s VF.\nThe Problem \nThe reliability of VF testing is critical in ensuring meaningful results which will accurately inform clinical management decisions. Reliability is often difficult to achieve, due to the initial learning curve for the patients, as well as variability in patient understanding and executing the test protocols. Current practices rely heavily on explanation and attention of the attending ophthalmic technician, and patient comprehension and cooperation \u2013 both of which may be highly variable, leading to unreliable results that can compromise the accuracy of disease monitoring. This undermines efforts to optimise treatment strategies tailored to individual patient needs.\nIn real-world clinical setting, appointment slots for VF testing are often limited by manpower and availability of testing devices. VF testing is a relatively time-consuming and tedious process, taking up to 10 minutes per patient, depending on the testing algorithm used. This does not include additional time required for equipment set up, patient transfer and explanation of testing process. Hence, when a patient\u2019s VF test results are unreliable, resource constraints make it challenging to schedule a retest in close time proximity. This leads to an inefficient use of appointment slots for the clinic, and a missed opportunity to collect valuable data for the patient\u2019s care. This would delay diagnosis or detection of disease progression.\nThe Problem Breakdown\nTo tackle this problem, we first spoke to ophthalmologists to identify the gaps in current practices. After extensive discussion, we broke the problem down into two parts: Instruction and Execution.\nInstruction: \nThe patients in which these ophthalmologists have the most trouble with, are usually the elderly. With this group of people, struggles usually originate from a communicative breakdown. Due to the relative complexity of the test, significant time is spent on clarification. This problem is also exacerbated by potential language barriers and/or hearing impairments. \nExecution:\nGiven the enclosed nature of the test and that results are not known until the end of the 10 minute long procedure, doctors or nurses would not be able to consistently track and correct any mistakes in execution. Hence, any misunderstandings, unconscious habits or errors will go unidentified and only be reflected in via a failed test.\nHence, we to sufficiently address both parts of the problem, we decided to 1. Create a simplified instructional video to relay information and 2. Make a pre-assessment simulation booth for patients to familiarise with test procedures and environment as well as nurses to identify any potential misunderstandings or errors. \nThis solution should provide standardised, user-friendly instruction for patients, accompanied by hands-on practical practice with immediate sensory or tactile feedback.\nIn totality, this aims to reduce the VF testing learning curve for patients and enhance patient education - thereby improving reliability and consistency of test outcomes.\nThe Early Prototype\nRun in Terminal, Simple one stop UX\nVisualiser system\n\nOur initial prototype consisted of several components. In our design, we aimed to adapt current technologies to reduce friction and workload. \nVisualiser to screen dots on a white back ground\nCamera with pupil tracking capabilities\nBasic electronics such as an Arduino with some buttons to record presses and a buzzer to provide haptic feedback on erroneous presses.\nSome dark box to ensure ample illumination from the visualiser\nSome major challenges we faced:\nCamera placement\nA big problem we we faced was placing the camera at an appropriate location that ensured ample view of the eye while also avoiding the reflection from the light thrown by the visualiser.\nIllumination\nSample rate and pupil tracker accuracy\nMid-course correction\nConsulted ophthalmologists and realised flaws with lightning, not intuitive\nOne step further in, utilise existing neck support, box architecture,\nThe HI-FI\n\u2018Laser Turret\u2019 to shine spots at particular coordinates \nStaged PyQt6 GUI, more intuitive UX, build initialise, start stop into GUI, do not need to touch the terminal\nCalibration stage to adjust for differences for each patient. \nAdapted pupil tracker with vectorised calculations\n3D Printed Box\nLearning Points\ntechnical growth exposure\nfancy technical architecture not important, just need to fulfil user requriements, meet user standards\nWhat Now?\nGPU integration with PCB for fast processing of images. Allow more calculations more accurate detection of pupil, allow more light correction and editing.\nActual user testing, to identify painpoints."
